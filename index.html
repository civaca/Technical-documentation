        <p>Gram-negative bacteria are bacteria that do not retain the crystal violet stain 
             used in the Gram staining method of bacterial differentiation.[1] They are characterized
            by their cell envelopes, which are composed of a thin peptidoglycan cell wall sandwiched
            between an inner cytoplasmic cell membrane and a bacterial outer membrane.</p>
        <p>Gram-negative bacteria are found in virtually all environments on Earth that support life.
            The gram-negative bacteria include: the model organism Escherichia coli, as well as many pathogenic 
                bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Yersinia pestis. This article explores
            the following bacteria: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</li>
            <li>Escherichia coli</li>
            <li>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</li>
            <li>Chlamydia trachomatis</li>

        <header  class="stitle">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</header>
        <p>Neisseria gonorrhoeae, <code>also known as gonococcus (singular), or gonococci (plural)</code>, is a species of Gram-negative
             diplococci bacteria isolated by Albert Neisser in 1879.[3] It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection 
             gonorrhea[4] as well as other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated gonococcemia, septic arthritis, and gonococcal 
             ophthalmia neonatorum.</p>
        <P>It is oxidase positive and aerobic, and it survives phagocytosis and grows inside neutrophils.[4] Culturing it requires carbon dioxide
             supplementation and enriched agar (chocolate agar) with various antibiotics (Thayer-Martin). It exhibits antigenic variation through
              genetic recombination of its pili and surface proteins that interact with the immune system.[3]</P>

    <section id="Escherichia_coli"class="main-section"> 
        <header  class="stitle">Escherichia coli</header>
        <p>Escherichia coli, <code>also known as E. coli</code>, is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that 
            is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms.[3][4] Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes (EPEC, ETEC etc.) 
            can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for food contamination incidents that prompt product recalls.[5</p>
        <P>The harmless strains are part of the normal microbiota of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2,[7] and preventing colonisation of 
            the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a mutualistic relationship.[8][9] E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium
             grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.[</P>

    <section id="Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"class="main-section"> 
        <header  class="stitle">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</header>
        <p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a <code>common encapsulated, Gram-negative</code>, strict aerobic (although can grow anaerobically in the presence of nitrate), rod-shaped bacterium 
            that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans.[1][2] A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized
             for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses – hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated 
             pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes.</p>
        <P>The organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions – most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns</P>

    <section id="Chlamydia_trachomatis"class="main-section"> 
        <header  class="stitle">Chlamydia trachomatis</header>
        <p>Chlamydia trachomatis,<code>commonly known as chlamydia</code>,  is a bacterium that causes chlamydia, which can manifest in various ways, including: trachoma, lymphogranuloma
             venereum, nongonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease. C. trachomatis is the most common infectious cause of blindness and the most common sexually transmitted 
             bacterium.[3]</p>
        <P>Different types of C. trachomatis cause different diseases. The most common strains cause disease in the <code>genital tract</code>, while other strains cause disease in the eye or lymph nodes</P>
